# CSS Style Guide

You may not like all rules presented here, but they work very well for
us and have helped producing high quality code. Everyone is free to
code however they want, write and follow their own style guides, but
when you contribute to our code, please follow these rules:

## Formatting

* Use ASCII (or UTF-8, if you have to).

* Use 2 space indent, no tabs.

* Use Unix-style line endings.

* Use spaces around `{` and before `}`.

* Use space after `:` and `;`.

* The last `;` is optional.

* Write selector declarations on a [single line](http://orderedlist.com/resources/html-css/single-line-css/).

* Group declarations together with a corresponding comment.

        /* FLASH MESSAGES
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
        .flash {
          padding: 9px 10px;
        }
        
        .flash-alert {
          background: #efd409;
          color: #fff;
        }

* Keep lines fewer than 120 or 300 characters, depending on the amount of declarations and common sense.

## General

* Use common sense.
